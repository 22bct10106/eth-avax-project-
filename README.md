Error Handling Smart Contract
This Solidity smart contract demonstrates error handling techniques using the require(), assert(), and revert() functions. The contract allows users to set a value while enforcing certain conditions and handling potential errors.

Contract Details
Contract Name
errorHandling

Prerequisites
Solidity version: ^0.8.0
State Variable
value: A public uint256 variable that holds the value set by users.
Function Details
setValue(uint256 newValue) external
This function allows users to set the value while enforcing conditions and handling errors:

Input Validation:
The function uses the require() function to ensure that the newValue is greater than 0. If the condition is not met, the transaction reverts with the error message "Value must be greater than 0."

Internal Error Check:
The assert() function is used to check if newValue is equal to 43. If it is, the transaction reverts. This assertion is used to catch unexpected internal errors.

Custom Error Handling:
If newValue is equal to 99, the function uses the revert() function to revert the transaction with the error message "Cannot set value to 99." This demonstrates how to handle specific cases with custom error messages.

Value Update:
If all the conditions are met and no errors occur, the value of value is updated with the new input newValue.

Usage
Deploy the smart contract to an Ethereum-compatible blockchain using a Solidity compiler that supports version ^0.8.0.

Once deployed, users can interact with the contract by calling the setValue(uint256 newValue) function and passing a new value as an argument.

The function will validate the input, perform internal checks, and handle errors based on the conditions specified.
